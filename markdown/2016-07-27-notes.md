## July 27, 2016

Today's Agenda:

1. Git/GitHub: clone, push and pull, and collaborate
2. Bash: commands for navigating the Linux file system
3. Python datatypes: `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `bool`

## 1. Git and GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is open source, version control software for managing software projects. [GitHub](https://github.com) is a website which hosts Git repositories and facilitates open source software collaboration.

Although it is possible to edit files in a repository on GitHub itself, most work is done locally (ie. on your own machine - for example, your JupyterHub account) and then changes are pushed and pulled from GitHub to your local Git repository. See [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/) for plenty of resources on using Git and GitHub.

In the exercise below, we will collaborate on GitHub following the GitHub collaborator workflow:

* A central user (ie. patrickwalls) creates a repository in their GitHub account
* The central user adds collaborators to the repository by their username
* Collaborators clone the GitHub repository from the central user to their own machines
* Collaborators make changes locally and push them to GitHub
* Collaborators pull other people's changes from GitHub to their local machine
* Communications, conflicts and ideas are shared in the issues tab of the GitHub repository

### Exercise 1.1: Collaborating on GitHub

`patrickwalls` created a repository on GitHub for us to share resources for the seminar:

```
http://github.com/patrickwalls/ubcs3-resources
```

1. Become a collaborator for the repository:
    * Go to the issues tab of the repository and post a message on the issue titled "Looking for collaborators!"
    * `patrickwalls` will add your username to the list of collaborators
    * You now have push access to the repository
2. Clone the GitHub repository to your JupyterHub account:
    * Login to JupyterHub
    * Open a new terminal
    * Enter the command `git clone https://github.com/patrickwalls/ubcs3-resources.git`
3. Make a contribution and push it to GitHub:
    * On JupyterHub, create a .md file which introduces an online resource you think would be helpful to others
    * To avoid conflicts, let's all name our files in the form `username-resource.md`. For example, to share [Visualizing Git with D3](https://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/), I would name my file `patrickwalls-visualizing-git.md` and save it to the `git-resources` folder in the repo.
    * In the terminal, navigate to your cloned repo and push your contribution to GitHub by entering these commands:
        * Add your changes to the staging area: `git add <filename>`
        * Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Added resource for ... "`
        * Push your changes: `git push origin master`
            * If someone has pushed changes since the last time you pulled in from the GitHub repo, you must enter the command `git pull` to update your local repo before you can push your changes
            * If you pull changes after you have made changes to your local repo, the commmand `git pull` performs a merge and Git will open the Emacs text editor and require you to write a merge commit message
            * In Emacs, you can simply enter `CTRL-x CTRL-s` to save the default commit message and then `CTRL-x CTRL-c` to exit
4. Pull everyone's changes from GitHub to your cloned repo on JupyterHub:
    * In the terminal, navigate to your cloned repo and enter the command `git pull`

## 2. Bash

The [Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is a program on a Linux machine where the user types commands to interact with the Linux operating system. There are *many* powerful Bash commands designed for different purposes:

* navigating the file system
* creating and deleting elements in the file system
* finding files and directories in the file system
* editing and manipulating files and directories
* setting permissions on files and directories
* managing users and networks
* et cetera

At the moment, we will only consider the most common Bash commands (see the [Bash Shell Cheat Sheet](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf)):

* `pwd` – print working directory
* `ls` – list contents of the working directory
* `mkdir <directoryname>` – create a new directory
* `cd <directoryname>` – navigate into the specified directory
* `less <filename>` – view the contents of a file
* `cat <filename>` – display contents of a file in the terminal
* `head <filename>` - display the top 10 lines of a file
  * `head -n <filename>` to display the top `n` lines
* `tail <filename>` - display the last 10 lines of a file
  * `tail -n <filename>` to display the last `n` lines
* `rm <filename>` – delete a file (immediately and permanently!)
* `mv <filename> <destination>` - move (or rename) a file
* `wc <filename>` – show the number of lines, words, bytes or characters in a file
* `sort <filename>` – sort the contents of a file
* `curl <url>` – retrieve and output the contents of the file located at the specified URL

### Exercise 2.1: Exploring the Git repository

Open a new terminal in JupyterHub and enter the following commands:

* Orient yourself in the file system:
    * `pwd`
    * `ls`
* Navigate into the Git repo cloned in Exercise 1.1 above and view its contents:
    * `cd ubcs3-resources`
    * `ls`
* One directory at a time, navigate into the directory, list its contents, view a file and navigate back to the directory above it:
    * `cd git-resources`
    * `ls`
    * `less patrickwalls-visualizing-git.md`
    * `cd ..`

### Exercise 2.2: Sorting word counts in text files

* Navigate to the `git-resources` directory in the `ubcs3-resources` directory
* Choose a file and enter the commmand `wc <filename>` to see the number of lines, words and characters in the file
* Enter the command `wc -w *.md` to see the number of words in each file in the current directory which end in `.md`
    * The asterisk is called a [wildcard](http://www.linfo.org/wildcard.html) and the expression `*.md` translates to "any file ending in `.md`"
    * The option `-w` is called a flag and specifies the option to only show the number of words in the file
* Finally, to order the files in terms of the words in each file, enter the command `wc -w *.md | sort -n`
    * The character `|` is a [pipe](http://www.linfo.org/pipe.html) and takes the output from the first command `wc -w *.md` and uses it as input into the second command `sort -n`

## 3. Python

### Datatypes

There are several built in datatypes in Python. See the [Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) for a complete list of types.

#### Integers - `int`

Here are a few examples of operations involving integers:


```python
1 + 2
```




    3




```python
1 - 2
```




    -1




```python
7 * 13
```




    91




```python
2 ** 3
```




    8




```python
9 / 2 # division always returns a float
```




    4.5




```python
9 // 2 # floor division rounds down to the nearest integer
```




    4




```python
type(1 + 2) # check the type
```




    int



#### Floats - `float`

Notice that in Python 3 division involving integers always returns a float:


```python
100 / 10
```




    10.0



More examples of operations involving floats:


```python
2 ** 0.5
```




    1.4142135623730951




```python
type(3.14159)
```




    float



#### Strings - `str`

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in (single or double) quotes. Here are some operations involving strings:


```python
"hello"
```




    'hello'




```python
"hello" + "world"
```




    'helloworld'




```python
"hello" * 3
```




    'hellohellohello'




```python
type("howdy")
```




    str



#### Lists -  `list`

Lists are ordered sequences of arbitrary Python objects. We use brackets and commas (ie. `[1,2,3]`) to define lists:


```python
[1,2,3]
```




    [1, 2, 3]




```python
[1,"one",1.0]
```




    [1, 'one', 1.0]




```python
[1,2,3,4] + [5,6,7,8] + [9,10,11,12]
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]




```python
type(['h','e','l','l','o'])
```




    list



#### Boolean - `bool`

Boolean type consists of `True` and `False`. The usual [comparison operators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons) `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=` along with the [boolean operators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not) `and`, `or`, `not` produce boolean types.


```python
1 > 2
```




    False




```python
'Hello' != 'hello'
```




    True




```python
3 * 8 == 4 * 6
```




    True




```python
type(True)
```




    bool
