[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/patrickwalls/ubc-scientific-software-seminar/notebooks//2016-08-03-notes/2016-08-03-notes.ipynb)

## August 3, 2016

Today's Agenda:

1. Bash
    * Review: Bash commands
    * More Bash commands
    * Exercise: Scraping the web
2. Python: logic, loops and functions
3. A quick intro to NumPy and matplotlib 

### 1. Bash

We can execute Bash commands in at least 3 ways:

1. Enter Bash commands in the terminal
2. Enter Bash commands (beginning with a bang character `!`) in a code cell in a Jupyter notebook
3. Write several lines of Bash commands in a text file with extension `.sh` and call it from the terminal:

```bash
bash my_script.sh
```

### 1.1 Review: Bash commands

Recall, we have already used several simple Bash commands:

#### Interacting with the file system
* `pwd`
* `ls`
* `cd`

#### Creating/removing files and directories
* `mkdir`
* `rm`
* `mv`

#### Viewing contents of a file

* `less`
* `cat`
* `head`
* `tail`
* `wc`
* `sort`


```python
! head -3 ../README.md
```

    ## UBC Scientific Software Seminar
    
    The UBC Scientific Software Seminar is inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and its goal is to help students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC develop software skills for science.



```python
! wc -l ../README.md
```

          62 ../README.md


Note that `..` is a reference to the directory above the current working directory.

#### Pipes, redirections and wildcards

We also saw how to use the output of one command as the input into another using the pipe character `|`, and how to redirect output to a file using the character `>`.

### 1.2 More Bash commands

Today, we'll look at more advanced commmands such as:

* `curl`
* `grep`
* `find`
* `cut`
* `rev`
* `date`
* `sleep`

See the [Bash cheat sheet](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf) for details regarding these commands.

#### curl

The command `curl` fetches a file from a given url and prints the result to standard output.

For example, we can fetch the [collected works of Shakespeare](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt) and redirect the output to a file named `shakespeare.txt`:


```python
! curl http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt > shakespeare.txt
```

      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100 5458k  100 5458k    0     0  3182k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 3183k



```python
# Look at the first 20 lines of the file
! head -20 shakespeare.txt
```

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    



```python
# Count the number of lines in the file
! wc -l shakespeare.txt
```

      124787 shakespeare.txt


#### grep

The command `grep` looks in a file for the occurence of a pattern of characters specified by a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). We won't go into regular expressions today and so we'll restrict our searches to words and phrases.

For example, let's count the number of times the word "love" appears in Shakespeare's works (ignoring case):


```python
# Count the number of occurences of "love"
# The flag -i ignores case and so looks for "love", "Love", "LOVE", etc.
! grep -i love shakespeare.txt | wc -l
```

        2653


We can also look for phrases:


```python
! grep "wherefore art thou" shakespeare.txt
```

    



```python
# The flags -B and -A show lines occuring before and after the search text
! grep -B 2 -A 4 "grave man" shakespeare.txt
```

    
    
    
    
    
    
    



```python
! rm shakespeare.txt
```

### 1.3 Exercise: Scraping the web

Write a Bash script which fetches the headlines from several different RSS feeds from cbc.ca (see [cbc.ca/rss/](http://www.cbc.ca/rss/)) and saves them to a text file with a time stamp. Go even further and write the script so that it fetches headlines every 15 minutes.

As a first step, let's get an XML file from [cbc.ca](http://www.cbc.ca) and take a look at it:


```python
! curl http://www.cbc.ca/cmlink/rss-topstories > topstories-raw.txt
```

      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100 18540  100 18540    0     0   779k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  787k



```python
! head -30 topstories-raw.txt
```

We can see that the headlines are contained in `<title>` tags and so we can use `grep` to find these lines. Notice that the characters `<` and `>` are special characters in Bash and so we need to use the escape character `\`.


```python
! grep \<title\> topstories-raw.txt
```

The lines which contain headlines have 22 characters at the beginning of each line which we would like to cut out. We can use the `cut` command to accomplish this task. (See the Bash cheat sheet or Google `bash cut` for help.)


```python
! grep \<title\> topstories-raw.txt | cut -c 23-
```

Now there are 11 characters at the end of each line we would like to eliminate. We can use the command `rev` to reverse the order of each line and then use `cut` to remove these characters.


```python
! grep \<title\> topstories-raw.txt | cut -c 23- | rev | cut -c 12- | rev
```

Finally, we want to eliminate the first two lines and then write the result to a file named `topstories.txt`. We can use the command `tail` to select all but the first two lines.


```python
! grep \<title\> topstories-raw.txt | cut -c 23- | rev | cut -c 12- | rev | tail -n +3 > topstories.txt
! rm topstories-raw.txt
! cat topstories.txt
```

```python
# Now that we have things working, let's remove the file
! rm topstories.txt
```

Finally, let's assemble these commands into a textfile named `get-headlines.sh` and wrap the commands in a for loop to fetch headlines from several different RSS feeds: topstories, canada, politics, offbeat, sports-nba and canada-britishcolumbia. Notice that we use the character `$` to access the value of the variable `subject` in the for loop.

```bash
# get-headlines.sh

for subject in topstories canada politics offbeat sports-nba canada-britishcolumbia
do
curl http://www.cbc.ca/cmlink/rss-$subject > $subject-raw.txt
grep \<title\> $subject-raw.txt | cut -c 23- | rev | cut -c 12- | rev | tail -n +3 > $subject.txt
rm $subject-raw.txt
done
```


```python
! bash get-headlines.sh
```

```python
# Remove the text files created by get-headlines.sh
! rm *.txt

#### Scraping the web repeatedly with logging

Taking this example further, we can add some code so that our Bash script get headlines every 15 minutes and writes the headlines with names including the date and time. The result is the following:

```bash
# get-headlines-repeat.sh

while true
do

  for subject in topstories canada politics offbeat sports-nba canada-britishcolumbia
  do

    # Get the current datetime in the given format
    now=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")
    
    curl http://www.cbc.ca/cmlink/rss-$subject > $subject-raw.txt
    
    grep \<title\> $subject-raw.txt | cut -c 23- | rev | cut -c 12- | rev | tail -n +3 > $subject-$now.txt
    
    rm $subject-raw.txt
    
  done
  
  echo "Retrieved data at $now ..."
  sleep 900 # Sleep for 900 seconds = 15 minutes

done
```


```python
# UNCOMMENT THE NEXT LINE TO EXECUTE get-headlines-repeat.sh
# ! bash get-headlines-repeat.sh
```

### 2. Python: logic, loops and functions

The following is a quick tour of some parts of the standard Python library intended only as an introduction to Python syntax.

#### Comparison operators

* `==` (equal)
* `!=` (not equal)
* `<` (less than)
* `<=` (less than or equal to)
* `>` (greater than)
* `>=` (greater than or equal to)


```python
1 < 2
```




    True




```python
"Patrick" != "patrick"
```




    True




```python
100 >= 101
```




    False



#### Boolean operators

* `and`
* `or`
* `not`
* `in`


```python
1 < 2 and 1 < 3
```




    True




```python
5 % 2 == 2 or 2 + 4 == 2
```




    False




```python
'a' in 'aeiou'
```




    True




```python
1 not in ['1','2','3']
```




    True



#### Functions

Syntax to define a function:

```python
def fun(x):
    return x**2
```


```python
def fun(x):
    square = x**2
    return square
```


```python
fun(2)
```




    4




```python
fun(-1.234)
```




    1.522756



#### `if` statement

Syntax to define `if` statement:

```python
if logical_expression_1:
    # Python code block 1
    # indented statndard 4 spaces
elif logical_expression_2:
    # Python code block 2
    # indented statndard 4 spaces
else:
    # Python code block 3
    # indented statndard 4 spaces
```


```python
if 1 < 2:
    print('Duh!')
else:
    print("What?")
```

    Duh!


### Exercise 2.1: Roots of quadratics

Write a function which takes parameters a, b, and c and determines whether the polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$ has real distinct roots, complex roots or one real repeated root.


```python
def roots(a,b,c):
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    print("p(x) = {0}x^2 + {1}x + {2}".format(a,b,c))
    if discriminant > 0:
        print("Roots are real and distinct.")
    elif discriminant < 0:
        print("Roots are complex.")
    else:
        print("One repeated real root.")
```


```python
roots(1,0,1)
```

    p(x) = 1x^2 + 0x + 1
    Roots are complex.



```python
roots(1,0,-1)
```

    p(x) = 1x^2 + 0x + -1
    Roots are real and distinct.



```python
roots(1,2,1)
```

    p(x) = 1x^2 + 2x + 1
    One repeated real root.


#### `for` loop

Syntax to write a `for` loop:

```python
for variable in iterable_object:
    # Python code block
    # indented standard 4 spaces
```

Examples of iterable objects:

* lists
* strings
* an object returned by a generator function such as `range`


```python
noises = ["biz","bam","boom","pow"]
for noise in noises:
    noise = noise.upper() # string method .upper() returns the string in uppercase
    print(noise + "!")
```

    BIZ!
    BAM!
    BOOM!
    POW!



```python
my_name = "Patrick"
for letter in my_name:
    print("Give me a",letter + "!")
```

    Give me a P!
    Give me a a!
    Give me a t!
    Give me a r!
    Give me a i!
    Give me a c!
    Give me a k!



```python
for n in range(0,10):
    n_squared = n**2
    print(n, "squared is equal to", n_squared)
```

    0 squared is equal to 0
    1 squared is equal to 1
    2 squared is equal to 4
    3 squared is equal to 9
    4 squared is equal to 16
    5 squared is equal to 25
    6 squared is equal to 36
    7 squared is equal to 49
    8 squared is equal to 64

### Exercise 2.2: Partial sums of series

Write a function which takes parameters $x$ and $N$ and returns the $Nth$ partial sum of the Taylor series of $\log x$:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N (-1)^{n+1} \frac{(x-1)^n}{n}
$$


```python
def log_partial_sum(x,N):
    result = 0
    for n in range(1,N+1):
        result = result + (-1)**(n+1) * (x-1)**n / n
    return result
```


```python
# Check log(1) = 0
log_partial_sum(1,1)
```




    0.0




```python
# Check log(1/e) = -1
log_partial_sum(1/2.7182818284590451,50)
```




    -0.9999999999964204



### 3. NumPy and matplotlib

Python is a general purpose scripting language and can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Python packages are modules of Python scripts designed for a specific problem and the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) currently hosts over 85,000 open source packages!

There are Python packages for just about everything: server-side web applications, symbolic mathematical computation, image processing, interactive web-based data visualization, et cetera.

We will focus on the SciPy stack: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). These Python packages form the basis of scientific computing in Python.

NumPy is built for fast array computations. We'll explore the package further in the coming weeks but for now let's simply create some NumPy arrays. The first step with any package is to import it:


```python
import numpy as np
```

We access functions and objects in the NumPy package using the dot notation `np.______` (and so the abbreviated name `np` is a convention which simplifies each call to the package).


```python
np.linspace(0,1,11)
```




    array([ 0. ,  0.1,  0.2,  0.3,  0.4,  0.5,  0.6,  0.7,  0.8,  0.9,  1. ])



We can view the documentation in our Jupyter notebook using a question mark such as:


```python
np.linspace?
```

All the usual mathematical functions are included in NumPy and are vectorized: they accept arrays as arguments and apply functions elementwise.


```python
x = np.linspace(0,1,11)
y = np.exp(x)
print(x)
print(y)
```

    [ 0.   0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  1. ]
    [ 1.          1.10517092  1.22140276  1.34985881  1.4918247   1.64872127
      1.8221188   2.01375271  2.22554093  2.45960311  2.71828183]


matplotlib is a plotting library which is very similar to Matlab's plotting library. Let's import it with the statndard naming convention:


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

We need a bit of [magic](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). The following tells the Jupyter notebook to output matplotlib figures *inline*.


```python
%matplotlib inline
```

Now plotting is as simple as:


```python
x = np.linspace(0,50,1000)
y = np.exp(-0.1*x) * np.cos(x)
plt.plot(x,y)
```

### Exercise 3.1: Plotting mathematical functions

1. Plot the function $f(x) = 1 - x^2$ for $x \in [-2,2]$.
2. Plot the function $f(x) = \arctan x$ for $x \in [-5,5]$.
3. Plot the parametic curve $x(t) = \cos 3t$, $y(t) = \sin 2t$ for $t \in [0,2 \pi]$.
